How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

First, user needs are discussed between the software developer team and the client. This includes getting all the information on the requirements for the product and documenting what is going to create the perfect path to the dealine. Requirements, or user needs, should be implented based on their importance and should be gathered in a diagram to see how the product is going to work its best. User stories help with this by providing insight into the user needs from the end user point of view. User stories are where discussions can happen between the client and the developer to make sure that the qualities of the software are meeting the expectations set by the client.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs with a cleaar understanding of the requirements that need to be included in the product. I hope to incorporate all agile process into my future development work. Having a clear understanding of the requirements, creating a clear path, actually developing the product, testing the product and debugging, reviewing, and doing the cycle all over again makes sure that the product is just right for the client. Checking in with the client in case of changes is always important, and knowing how to properly utilize the agile processes can make the production possible.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development is someone that able to collaborate with others, can potentially be a good leader, understands their roles and responsibilites, has good social skills, and is motivated towards the end goal. A good team member is someone who can always work with a team.
